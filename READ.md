# Read me for week three homework

Firstly I created all arrays for my generator;
Also setting minimum length of my password;
And lastly an empty array that I can call later and fill;

Using the boilerplate code provided I built off the write password function, creating an if/else statement;


Using a for loop, I came up with way to randomize how many of each character the password is to have, then returning the password;

In the get prompt function, I set all the prompts and what is to have depending on selected choice utilizing concat;


After meeting with my tutor I came to find out I had an edge case in my code. If all prompts were not selected the password would return undefined. So I ended the get prompt function with an if statement on what to return if nothing was selected as far as the prompts;

I also added another button and utilizing the print() function, gave users the opportunity to print their results;

Also using another function, I left an easter egg in my assignment;
